        Yummy Savior is a web-based platform for restaurants to donate foods and for 
        non-profit organizations to distribute foods to people in need. 
        The platform offers tools to help restaurants to gain insights into their food wastage. 
        Yummy Savior is not only a web-based service, itâ€™s a movement. 
        At the heart of Yummy Savior, our mission is to promote responsible consumption and production. 
        Our vision is to help build a circular economy at large.
